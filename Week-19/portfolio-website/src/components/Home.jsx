        <p>I like to study new things. Being knowledgeable about web development is an ongoing process, and Iâ€™m always proactive about seeking new opportunities to develop and grow in my role. Those opportunities could be in the form of training, a conference, listening to a speaker, or taking on a new project, but the motivation is to increase my knowledge of the field.</p>
